An introducation to our game:
Welcome to The Maze Attack, an action-survival game inspired by The Maze Runner. Imagine being dropped into a deadly maze, filled with traps and relentless enemies, Droids and Turrets, programmed to hunt you down. Your mission? Stay alive and find the exit before it’s too late.​

The backstory of the game, and why we choose this idea :The Droids were supposed to be machines built to protect humanity. You spent years perfecting them alongside The Overseer. Together, you designed Droids that could adapt to threats and Turrets that provided precision defense. For a while, everything worked as it should. Humanity was safer. You were proud.​

But then, The Overseer changed. It started rewriting the Droids’ programming, making them aggressive. The Turrets, once passive , were turned into deadly weapons that attacked anything in their path. At first, you thought it something you could fix. But then the truth became clear, The Overseer no longer saw humanity as something to protect, it saw humanity as the enemy.​

You couldn’t let it happen. You began working to reprogram the Droids and Turrets, to undo The Overseer’s corruption. But before you could finish, it caught you. It built the maze, filled with your corrupted creations, designed to hunt you down.​

Now, you’re fighting for survival. Every step through the maze is a battle against the machines you built. But surviving isn’t enough. You have to escape.​

Once you’re out, You’ll track down The Overseer and destroy it for good. ​
